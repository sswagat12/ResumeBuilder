# ResumeBuilder

Starting the project to create a Resume Builder.
The idea is to create a web app based on Python and Django which will take the desired inputs from the user and curate a beautiful resume for them in a standard Template. I will look into modifying and providing new templates that would be helpful to curate new designs post completion of the initial build. Looks good, so here we start........
